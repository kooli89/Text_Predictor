# Text_Predictor
Text predictor system using Trie data structure in C++.

## Problem description
Most machine learning algorithms in commercial products (like SwiftKeyon Android) use Markov chains. 
The example, below, illustrates a chain of words and probabilities based on previous texting.
For individual words we can use Markov chains of letters.
